<h1>index</h1>
I know that the index acts as a staging area, and what is committed is in the index rather than the working tree. I am just curious about what an index object consists of. I guess it might be a list of filename/directory names, SHA-1 pairs, a kind of virtual tree maybe?

Is there, in Git terminology, any plumbing command that I can use to list the contents of the index?
